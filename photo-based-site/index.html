            On this page I have showcased pictures of some of my favorite
            things. These pictures include a couple that I took, and ones that I
            took of the internet. There are cool pictures of nature. Followed by
            pictures of Ancient Greece, these were from the internet. There are
            pictures of the best animals out there. Of course, I had to include
            my doggy, Ginger. Lastly, I showcase some of the coolest American
            Sport Stadiums across the country. The stadiums mostly focus on
            baseball stadiums with some college football ones being shown. I
            hope that you see what I see in all of these topics when you go
            through this page.
