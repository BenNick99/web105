    <h2>Baseball</h2>
        <p>Baseball is a widely appreciated sport that involves two teams, each consisting of nine players. The primary 
            objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team within a set number of innings. The sport's 
            essence lies in its historical significance, intricate strategies, and the anticipation generated by every pitch, 
            swing, and fielding maneuver. It's a sport that combines athleticism, cooperation, and a distinctive cultural 
            heritage, evolving from its origins to become a global sensation enjoyed by individuals of all ages and

            <P>Baseball was always my favorite sport since I was a toddler. It all started with a Little Tike's bat and tee that
                I had. From then I had always enjoyed the sport. My entire family also loved baseball so that definitely had an 
                impact on me. I started playing when I was 6 years old and ended up playing all the way till I was 17. Baseball 
                gave me some of the best memories I have in my entire life and I am so thankful for the expirences I had from 
                the amazing sporrt.

    <h2>Watching Movies</h2>
        <p>Watching movies is a universally beloved activity, isn't it? It's all about unwinding, immersing yourself in diverse 
            narratives and characters, and experiencing a range of emotions â€“ from laughter and excitement to deep introspection. 
            Whether you're indulging in a solitary movie night or enjoying the company of friends, movies serve as a conduit 
            for shared enjoyment and the exploration of varied feelings and fictional realms. So, let's gather some popcorn and 
            allow the cinematic enchantment to unfold! <!-- chatgpt -->

    <h2>Why Movies</h2>
        <p>I started to really get into watching movies during the pandemic. With being stuck inside all day long, I needed 
            something new to do. I've always been a fan of stories, but I wasn't much of a reader. When I was watching movies I 
            didn't feel the boredom of not being able to go anywhere. I started to not only watch movies for entertainment, but 
            I started to learn messages from them and that helped me mature in some of the most influential years of my life.
